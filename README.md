# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project involves the development of a classic Tic Tac Toe game using Python and the PyQt5 library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game is designed for two players and features a 3x3 grid where players take turns to place their symbols (X or O) in an attempt to win the game.
